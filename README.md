# BookstoreWebsite
Created a website using HTML5 and CSS based on a local website

BooksEnds is a Kailua, HI bookstore. I received permission from the owner to build a website based on her shop. This was created to exercise my HTML and CSS skills and was a fun website to build.

There is no functionality other than HTML and CSS.
